IMPLEMENTING 2 FACTOR AUTHENTICATION:

----------------------------------
authentication:
authentication is a process of allowing users to access a
particular file or a system.
authentication can be based on:
what you know - password
what you are - biometrics
what you have - smart card/key/OTP

----------------------------------
importance of 2 factor authentication:
attackers compromise systems by stealing or bypassing
one of the authentication mechanism.
example:
brute force a password
steal a smart card.
with just authentication, the attacker gets access to
systems when compromised.
with the help of 2 factor authentication,
we have more than 1 factor which
decreases the likelihood of compromise.
example:
attacker may have bruteforced the password
but doesn't know the OTP.
