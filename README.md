Implementing Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Project Overview:

----------------------------------

Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) is a security process that requires users to provide two different authentication factors to verify their identity. This project aims to implement 2FA to enhance the security of an application by adding an extra layer of protection beyond just a username and password.

Project Objectives:

1. Integrate 2FA into the Application: Implement 2FA using a combination of something the user knows (password) and something the user has (a temporary code sent via SMS, email, or generated by an authenticator app like Google Authenticator or Authy).

2. User-Friendly Interface: Develop a user-friendly interface that guides users through the 2FA setup process, including enrolling devices and backup options. The interface will also allow users to manage their 2FA settings, such as enabling, disabling, or resetting 2FA.

4. Backup and Recovery : Provide recovery options in case the user loses access to their 2FA device. This might include backup codes, biometric authentication, or additional verification through email.

By implementing 2FA, this project aims to significantly improve user account security, protecting sensitive information from unauthorized access.

IMPLEMENTING 2 FACTOR AUTHENTICATION:

----------------------------------
authentication:
authentication is a process of allowing users to access a
particular file or a system.
authentication can be based on:
what you know - password
what you are - biometrics
what you have - smart card/key/OTP

----------------------------------
importance of 2 factor authentication:
attackers compromise systems by stealing or bypassing
one of the authentication mechanism.
example:
brute force a password
steal a smart card.
with just authentication, the attacker gets access to
systems when compromised.
with the help of 2 factor authentication,
we have more than 1 factor which
decreases the likelihood of compromise.
example:
attacker may have bruteforced the password
but doesn't know the OTP.
